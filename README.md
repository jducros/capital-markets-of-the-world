# capital-markets-of-the-world
The Capital Markets of the World project concerns a historical investigation in what could be called the ‘information system(s)’ that have been responsible for the production and dissemination of price-sensitive stock-exchange information. Thoroughly anchored in a unique and very extensive collection of surviving primary stock exchange materials (price lists, financial intelligence, and contemporary financial journalism) hosted at the Graduate Institute (Geneva), the project a) seeks to develop a vocabulary and methodology to make sense of geographically and temporally distinct institutional set-ups of the production of financial information. By means of several case-studies, it will b) show how these set-ups of information production and dissemination can be related to specific modes of information consumption. This serves to reiterate the historical and material (!) mediation of financial information. Related to the latter the project c) simultaneously establishes a set of ‘best practices’ with regard to curating its unparallelled collection with an eye on online disclosure for the academic community. This entails, among others, the formulation of a ‘smart’ catalog (allowing the user to set the parameters of search etc.), and a data architecture that takes into account the non-textual (numerical) nature of the information contained.
The project has been conceived out of the regular, yet initially ‘naive’, use of primary materials of stock-exchange quotes (price lists, financial intelligence, and contemporary financial journalism) contained in an unparallelled collection of financial information gathered by the Crédit Lyonnais Service des Etudes Financières, and currently hosted by the Graduate Institute, Geneva (hereafter referred to as ‘the Collection’; cf. infra). Over time, multiple consulting of the Collection for information on distinct markets has bred an ethnological awareness of informative differences (cf. infra) that are typically sterilized or even erased in the conventional practice of extracting lists of data from primary sources. Indeed, whereas conventional projects non-reflectively assume financial information to be ‘ready-made’ for scholarly consumption, the project under discussion here stresses that the opposite is the case. The intuition is as follows: as exchanges do ‘valuable things’, i.e. are in charge of the production of economic value, the information they produce should also be considered to be the subject of intense pressures, which are reflected in the (primary and secondary) documents they produce. Consequently, the project finds that the institutional set-up of the production of financial information is self-referentially subject to the economic calculus of gain-and-loss that it produces and enacts
Inherited by the Graduate Institute in 2008 from the Crédit Agricole, which had received it from the Crédit Lyonnais after the merger between the two banks in 2002, the collection represents the preserved part of a once gigantic collection of economic and financial information gathered by the Crédit Lyonnais Service des Etudes Financières, created in 1871. Owing to difficulties of preservation —it had been stored stored in a former textile factory in Tourcoing in northern France, where it experienced damage from humidity— most of the collection was lost. Two major parts, however, survived. One is  the vast store of government budgets from countries over the world, which was sorted out through cooperation of EHESS and the University of Paris XII, under supervision of Professors Broder and Flandreau, and transferred to the Centre Technique du Livre, a state run library repository in France. The other is the collection of stock exchange publications which the Graduate Institute acquired from Crédit Agricole in 2008. 
Covering stock exchange information for 6 continents, the repository could be said to be Thoreau’s figurative “Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within (…), opening new channels (…) of thought.” Over 200 linear meters and counting, the collection covers an immense stock of information concerning the world of finance in the age of globalization.  High frequency quotation records from 68 stock exchanges from 41 countries constitute the main component of the collection. They bring to life the complexity of Stock Exchange trading, underscoring the multiplicity of exchanges: several for each country, sometimes several for one market, and occasionally (as for a rare series of prices for gold mines), one market for several cities —as was the case for South African Gold Mines options traded simultaneously over the counter in Paris and London, and for which one Hirsch, a bullion broker in London and Paris produced a price list.The most complete series, such as London, New York, Brussels, or Amsterdam cover over 100 years of stock exchange quotations. More exotic or rare series, such as Bilbao, Alexandria or Cairo have shorter time frames but are still complete.  This stock (no pun intended) of information offers a very rare opportunity for a better understanding of the world of capitalism and finance as it opens up a transnational dimension, beyond the well-researched operation of individual markets. It discloses the entangled spatial logics of capital raising, trading and the global architecture of financial information.
